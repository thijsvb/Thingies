# bfAnimation
## is my first animation thingie written in Brainfuck, just input anything to see what it does!

The file `bfAnimation` has just the program, while `bfAnimationComments` also has whitespace and comments to explain the program

I use beef to run it in my terminal

To get beef run `sudo apt-get install beef`

To use to run bfAnimation, go to this folder then run `beef bfAnimation`
